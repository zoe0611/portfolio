## Projects
### Natural Language Processing
Developed a Natural Language Processing data pipiline to determine the similarities and differences between 800 agricultural research projects within the U.S. Department of Agriculture using **Python** and created a visualization in **Tableau** of the clusters that emerge. We used TF-IDF to calculate the importance of each word to its project plan and applied HDBSCAN clustering algorithm to build clusters. This data-driven approach helped clients determine the appropriate resources to research projects and encourage collaboration to improve capacity and scientific discovery.
