## Projects
### Natural Language Processing
There are about 800 Agricultural Research Service projects in progress. The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's wants to provide the appropriate resources to these projects and encourage collaboration to improve capacity and scientific discovery. 
<br><br>
Developed a Natural Language Processing data pipiline to determine the similarities and differences between projects within ARS’ National Program using **Python** and create a visualization in **Tableau** of the clusters that emerge. This data-driven approach helped ARS leaders easily assess shared and unique facets among the projects that comprise ARS national programs.
